## 🎯 KEY ALGORITHMS

### Risk Scoring
```javascript
Base Score:
- High-risk symptoms: +60
- Medium-risk symptoms: +35
- Low-risk symptoms: +10

Vital Adjustments:
- Critical BP: +25
- Abnormal HR: +20
- Critical temp: +20
- Low O2: +30

Medical History: +5

Final Risk Level:
- Score ≥60: High Risk
- Score ≥30: Medium Risk
- Score <30: Low Risk
```

### Severity Score (Queue Priority)
```javascript
severityScore = riskMultiplier[level] + (waitingMinutes / 5)

Multipliers:
- High: 100
- Medium: 50
- Low: 20
```

### Doctor Assignment
```javascript
1. Count current assignments per doctor
2. Sort by load (ascending)
3. Assign to doctor with lowest load
```
