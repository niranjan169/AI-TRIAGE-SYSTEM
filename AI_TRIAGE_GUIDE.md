# 🤖 AI TRIAGE ALGORITHM - HOW IT WORKS

## ✅ FIXED! Now Analyzes Symptoms Properly

The AI triage system now **intelligently analyzes** symptoms and vitals to determine risk level.

---

## 🎯 How Risk Levels Are Determined:

### **High Risk (70+ points)** → Emergency Department
- Critical symptoms detected
- Dangerous vital signs
- Requires immediate attention

### **Medium Risk (35-69 points)** → Urgent Care
- Urgent symptoms
- Abnormal vitals
- Needs prompt evaluation

### **Low Risk (0-34 points)** → General Practice
- Routine symptoms
- Normal or slightly abnormal vitals
- Standard consultation

---

- 🟢 Joint Pain: 15 points

### **Vital Signs Scoring:**

**Blood Pressure:**
- Critically High (≥180/120): +30 points
- Critically Low (<90/60): +25 points
- Elevated (≥140/90): +10 points

**Heart Rate:**
- Tachycardia (>120 bpm): +20 points
- Bradycardia (<50 bpm): +20 points
- Slightly abnormal (>100 or <60): +8 points

**Temperature:**
- Critically High (≥104°F): +25 points
- Critically Low (<95°F): +25 points
- Fever (≥100.4°F): +12 points

**Oxygen Level:**
- Critical (<90%): +35 points
- Low (<95%): +15 points

**Additional Factors:**
- Complex medical history: +5 points
- Multiple symptoms (4+): +10 points

## 🧪 Test Examples:

### **Example 1: Low Risk**
**Symptoms:** Headache, Fatigue
**Vitals:** BP: 120/80, HR: 72, Temp: 98.6°F, O2: 98%

**Calculation:**
- Headache: 12 points
- Fatigue: 12 points
- All vitals normal: 0 points
- **Total: 24 points → LOW RISK**

**Result:**
- Risk Level: Low
- Department: General Practice
- Confidence: ~82%

---

### **Example 2: Medium Risk**
**Symptoms:** High Fever, Cough, Headache
**Vitals:** BP: 125/82, HR: 95, Temp: 102.5°F, O2: 96%

**Calculation:**
- High Fever: 35 points
- Cough: 10 points
- Headache: 12 points
- Temperature (102.5°F): 12 points
- **Total: 69 points → MEDIUM RISK**

**Result:**
- Risk Level: Medium
- Department: Urgent Care
- Confidence: ~92%

---

### **Example 3: High Risk**
**Symptoms:** Chest Pain, Difficulty Breathing
**Vitals:** BP: 160/95, HR: 110, Temp: 99.1°F, O2: 92%

**Calculation:**
- Chest Pain: 70 points
- Difficulty Breathing: 65 points (takes highest)
- BP elevated: 10 points
- HR slightly high: 8 points
- O2 low: 15 points
- **Total: 108 points → HIGH RISK**

**Result:**
- Risk Level: High
- Department: Emergency Department
- Confidence: ~92%

---

### **Example 4: Critical High Risk**
**Symptoms:** Severe Bleeding, Loss of Consciousness
**Vitals:** BP: 85/55, HR: 125, Temp: 97.2°F, O2: 88%

**Calculation:**
- Loss of Consciousness: 80 points
- BP critically low: 25 points
- HR tachycardia: 20 points
- O2 critical: 35 points
- **Total: 160 points (capped at 100) → HIGH RISK**

**Result:**
- Risk Level: High
- Department: Emergency Department
- Confidence: 95%

## 🎨 What You'll See:

### **Low Risk Result:**
```
Risk Level: Low (Score: 24/100)
Department: General Practice
Confidence: 82%
Reasoning: "Symptoms suggest medical consultation is recommended. 
Heart rate slightly abnormal."

Recommendation: Routine Appointment Suggested
You can schedule at your convenience
```

### **Medium Risk Result:**
```
Risk Level: Medium (Score: 52/100)
Department: Urgent Care
Confidence: 88%
Reasoning: "Urgent symptoms requiring prompt evaluation. 
Urgent symptom: High Fever. Fever detected."

Recommendation: Urgent Consultation Recommended
You will be scheduled for next available appointment
```

### **High Risk Result:**
```
Risk Level: High (Score: 85/100)
Department: Emergency Department
Confidence: 93%
Reasoning: "Critical symptoms detected requiring immediate medical attention. 
Critical symptom: Chest Pain. Blood pressure readings outside normal range."

Recommendation: Emergency Attention Required
You will be placed in priority queue with earliest available slot
```

## 🔍 How It Analyzes:

1. **Normalizes symptoms** (lowercase, trim whitespace)
2. **Matches against symptom database** (uses partial matching)
3. **Takes highest symptom score** (not cumulative for symptoms)
4. **Adds vital sign scores** (cumulative)
5. **Adds modifiers** (medical history, multiple symptoms)
6. **Calculates final score**
7. **Determines risk level** based on thresholds
8. **Assigns department** based on risk
9. **Calculates confidence** based on score
10. **Generates reasoning** with detected issues

## ✅ Now Test It:

### **Test 1: Low Risk**
- Symptoms: Headache, Cough
- Vitals: Leave empty or normal
- **Expected:** Low Risk, General Practice

### **Test 2: Medium Risk**
- Symptoms: High Fever, Nausea, Headache
- Vitals: Temp: 102°F
- **Expected:** Medium Risk, Urgent Care

### **Test 3: High Risk**
- Symptoms: Chest Pain, Difficulty Breathing
- Vitals: HR: 125, O2: 91%
- **Expected:** High Risk, Emergency Department

### **Test 4: Very Low Risk**
- Symptoms: Sore Throat
- Vitals: All normal
- **Expected:** Low Risk, General Practice

## 🎯 Key Improvements:

✅ **Smart symptom matching** - Partial matching, case-insensitive
✅ **Proper scoring** - Uses highest symptom score, not cumulative
✅ **Vital signs analysis** - Properly parses and evaluates all vitals
✅ **Detailed reasoning** - Shows which symptoms/vitals triggered the score
✅ **Realistic confidence** - Based on actual risk score
✅ **Three distinct levels** - Low, Medium, High (not always High!)
